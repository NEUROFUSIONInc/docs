Onboarding questions are pre-join screening questions shown to participants after the [full-text overview](/onboarding/full-text-overview) (if configured). Use them for eligibility screening, demographic collection, and baseline data.

## Question Fields

Each onboarding question has:

| Field | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Question text** | ✅ Yes | The question shown to the participant |
| **Response type** | ✅ Yes | How participants answer (see table below) |
| **Options** | For `customOptions` only | Array of option strings |
| **Required** | — | Whether the question must be answered (defaults to `true` for new questions) |
| **Validation rule** | Optional | A [question guard](/onboarding/question-guards) for eligibility screening |

## Response Types

Onboarding questions support the same 5 response types as prompts:

| Response Type | UI Rendering | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text` | Text input field | Free-form answer |
| `yesno` | Two radio buttons: "Yes" / "No" | Binary choice |
| `number` | Numeric input field | Numeric answer |
| `numberRange` | Numeric input with bounds | Bounded numeric |
| `customOptions` | Radio buttons **or** checkboxes | See below |

### Custom Options Rendering

The rendering of `customOptions` depends on whether a [question guard](/onboarding/question-guards) is set:

- If the guard uses `in` or `not_in` → **checkboxes** (multi-select), answer stored as comma-separated values
- Otherwise → **radio buttons** (single-select)

<Warning>
  Options in onboarding questions are entered as **comma-separated** values (e.g., `Student, Professional, Retired, Other`). This is different from prompt custom options, which use **semicolons**.
</Warning>

## Adding Questions

1. Open your quest in the editor
2. Navigate to the onboarding section
3. Click **Add Question**
4. Enter the question text
5. Select a response type
6. If using `customOptions`, enter the options
7. Optionally toggle **Required** (on by default)
8. Optionally add a [validation rule (question guard)](/onboarding/question-guards)

## Validation

**Client-side**: All required questions must have a non-empty, trimmed answer before the form can be submitted.

**Server-side**: If any question has a [question guard](/onboarding/question-guards), the answers are validated server-side. Failed validations show rejection messages and block the participant from joining.

## Data Storage

- Onboarding responses are saved as a dataset with type `onboarding_responses`
- Source is tagged as `web` or `mobile` depending on where the participant completed onboarding
- Onboarding responses are **free** — they are not billed

<Info>
  Onboarding responses are submitted **before** the participant joins the quest. This is different from prompt responses, which are submitted after joining.

## Example

A typical eligibility screening setup:

| Question | Type | Guard |
|---|---|---|
| "How old are you?" | `number` | Must be ≥ 18 |
| "Do you consent to participate?" | `yesno` | Must equal "Yes" |
| "What is your primary language?" | `customOptions` (English, Spanish, French, Other) | Must be "English" or "Spanish" |
| "Describe any relevant medical conditions" | `text` | None (informational only) |
