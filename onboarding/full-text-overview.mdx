The full-text overview is a **rich HTML content block** displayed to participants as the first step of onboarding, before any questions. It's designed for informed consent language, study descriptions, and data usage policies.

## How It Works

1. When a participant opens a quest with a configured overview, they see the HTML content rendered in a styled container
2. Below the content is a **mandatory acknowledgment checkbox**: _"I have read and understand the information above"_
3. The **Continue** button is disabled until the checkbox is checked
4. After acknowledging, participants proceed to onboarding questions (if any) or directly to joining the quest

## Configuration

The overview is configured in the quest editor's onboarding section:

- **Content field** — enter or paste rich HTML content
- Stored in `onboardingConfig.content` as an HTML string
- If left empty, the overview step is skipped entirely

## What to Include

A good overview should cover:

- **Study title and principal investigator** — who is running this study
- **Purpose** — what the study is investigating
- **What's expected** — duration, tasks (prompts, experiments), time commitment
- **Data usage** — how data will be collected, stored, and used
- **Privacy** — who has access to the data, how long it's retained
- **Risks and benefits** — any potential risks and what participants gain
- **Voluntary participation** — participants can withdraw at any time
- **Contact information** — who to reach out to with questions

<Tip>
  Keep language accessible — aim for an 8th-grade reading level. Avoid jargon where possible and define technical terms when you must use them.
</Tip>

## Example

Here's an example of content you might put in the overview:

```html
<h2>Informed Consent — Daily Mood Study</h2>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Dr. Jane Smith, Department of Psychology</p>

<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>This study examines daily mood patterns and their relationship to sleep quality
over a 4-week period.</p>

<h3>What You'll Do</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Answer 3 short prompts each day (takes ~2 minutes)</li>
  <li>Complete one 5-minute cognitive experiment at the start and end of the study</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data & Privacy</h3>
<p>Your responses are stored securely on encrypted servers. Only the research team
has access to identified data. Published results will use anonymized, aggregate data only.</p>

## Notes

- The overview content supports any valid HTML — you can include headings, lists, links, bold text, etc.
- Content is rendered inside a `prose` container for clean typography
- The overview is optional — if you don't need a consent form, you can skip it
- If you need to re-show the overview to returning participants (e.g., on shared devices), enable [Kiosk Mode](/onboarding/kiosk-mode)
