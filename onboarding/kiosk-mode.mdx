Kiosk mode is an onboarding setting that **re-shows the full onboarding flow every session**, even for participants who have already joined the quest. It's designed for shared devices where multiple people use the same browser or app.

## Default Behavior (Kiosk Off)

When kiosk mode is **disabled** (the default):

1. A participant opens the quest URL for the first time → sees onboarding → joins the quest
2. The same participant opens the quest URL again → **skips onboarding** → goes directly to quest content

## Kiosk Behavior (Kiosk On)

When kiosk mode is **enabled**:

1. A participant opens the quest URL → sees onboarding → joins the quest
2. The same participant (or a different person on the same device) opens the quest URL again → **sees onboarding again** → must complete the overview acknowledgment and questions every time

## When to Use Kiosk Mode

| Scenario | Why |
|---|---|
| **Lab computers** shared by multiple participants | Each participant needs to see the consent form and answer screening questions |
| **Conference or event demo stations** | Walk-up stations where different people try the quest |
| **Clinical settings** with shared tablets | Patients use the same device in a waiting room or clinic |
| **Classroom studies** | Students share computers in a lab setting |

## How to Enable

1. Open your quest in the editor
2. Navigate to the onboarding section
3. Toggle **Kiosk Mode** on

The setting is stored in `onboardingConfig.isKiosk`.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
  Kiosk mode only affects the onboarding flow. It does **not** log out the user or reset other session state. If you need full session isolation on shared devices, consider additional measures like browser private/incognito mode.
</Warning>

- The full-text overview (if configured) is re-shown with the acknowledgment checkbox
- All onboarding questions (if any) are re-shown and must be answered again
- Question guard validation runs again every session
- Onboarding responses are saved as a new dataset entry each time
