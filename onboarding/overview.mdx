The onboarding system is a **multi-step gated flow** that participants must complete before they can access a quest's prompts and experiments. It handles informed consent, eligibility screening, and baseline data collection.

## Onboarding Flow

When a participant opens a quest URL, here's what happens:

```
Participant opens quest URL
  → Check if already joined
    → Already joined (not kiosk mode) → Skip to quest content
    → Already joined (kiosk mode) → Re-show onboarding
    → Not joined → Continue to onboarding
  → Step 1: Full-text overview (if configured)
    → Must check "I have read and understand" → Continue
  → Step 2: Onboarding questions (if any)
    → Server-side validation of question guards
      → Failed → Show rejection messages, block access
      → Passed → Continue
  → Save onboarding responses (free — not billed)
  → Join quest (billed to org — see [Pricing](https://usefusion.ai/pricing))
  → Quest content (prompts, experiments)
```

## Components

The onboarding system has four configurable components:

| Component | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Full-Text Overview](/onboarding/full-text-overview) | Optional | Rich HTML consent content with mandatory acknowledgment |
| [Onboarding Questions](/onboarding/questions) | Optional | Screening questions (5 response types supported) |
| [Question Guards](/onboarding/question-guards) | Optional | Server-side validation rules to block ineligible participants |
| [Kiosk Mode](/onboarding/kiosk-mode) | Optional | Re-show onboarding every session for shared devices |

A quest can have **none, one, or all** of these configured. If neither the overview nor questions are set, participants join the quest directly.

## Key Facts

- Onboarding responses are saved as a dataset with type `onboarding_responses`
- Onboarding responses are **free** — they are not billed
- Question guard validation is **server-side** — it cannot be bypassed
- Onboarding response types match prompt response types: `text`, `yesno`, `number`, `numberRange`, `customOptions`
