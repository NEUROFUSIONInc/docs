<Warning>
  **This page is deprecated.** The public-key collaborator method has been replaced by the Organizations system.
</Warning>

Quest collaboration is now managed through **Organizations**. Instead of sharing public keys, you can:

1. **Create an organization** — [Creating an Organization](/organizations/creating-an-org)
2. **Add team members** with granular permissions — [Members & Permissions](/organizations/members-and-permissions)
3. **Assign quests** to the organization — [Managing Quests](/organizations/managing-quests)

This gives you fine-grained control over who can edit quests, publish, access data, and manage billing — far more powerful than the old public-key method.

➡️ **[Go to Members & Permissions →](/organizations/members-and-permissions)**
