Fusion uses a **credit-based billing system**. Credits are the currency for all platform actions — publishing quests, storing data, running experiments, and more.

## How Credits Work

| Concept | Value |
|---|---|
| **1 credit** | 1 cent |
| **Starter bonus** | Free credits for every new organization |

Credits are managed at the **organization level**. Every action that costs credits is charged to the organization that owns the quest. See the **[Pricing page](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)** for current credit values and costs.

## What Costs Credits

The following actions consume credits from your organization's balance:

| Action | Category |
|---|---|
| Publish a quest | Quest & Experiments |
| Participant joins a quest | Quest & Experiments |
| Experiment data submission | Quest & Experiments |
| Brain recording (EEG) | Data Collection |
| Prompt response stored | Data Collection |
| Health data sync (wearable) | Data Collection |
| Dataset storage | Storage |
| AI data analysis | Analysis & AI |

For current prices, see the **[Pricing page](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)**.

### Free Actions

These actions are **free** and do not consume credits:

- Creating a quest (draft)
- Editing a quest
- Adding prompts and experiments
- Configuring onboarding
- Onboarding responses (no charge)
- Viewing data in the dashboard
- Adding organization members

## Re-Publishing Is Free

The first time you publish a quest, it costs credits. **Re-publishing** the same quest (after unpublishing and making changes) is free — the system checks for a prior publish transaction.

## Debt Tolerance

Some operations allow a small amount of debt to prevent data loss:

| Action | Debt Allowed |
|---|---|
| Publishing a quest | ❌ No — strict check, returns error if balance too low |
| Data collection (experiment, prompt, EEG, etc.) | ✅ Yes — small debt allowed |

<Info>
  Data collection actions never fail due to insufficient credits. The system allows a small amount of debt so participant data is never lost. Publishing, however, requires a sufficient balance.

## Low Balance Warning

When your organization's credit balance is running low, an amber warning appears on the dashboard:

> *"Your credit balance is running low. Add credits to continue using premium features."*
