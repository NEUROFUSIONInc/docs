The expense breakdown gives you visibility into exactly where your credits are going — broken down by quest, item type, participant count, and source (web or mobile).

## Viewing Expenses

Navigate to your organization's **Billing** page to see:

- **Current balance** — your available credits in dollars
- **Total spent** — cumulative spending across all quests
- **Per-quest breakdown** — expenses grouped by quest

## Expense Categories

All charges fall into one of four categories:

### Quest & Experiments

| Item | When Charged |
|---|---|
| Publish Quest | First time a quest is published |
| Quest Join | Each time a participant joins |
| Experiment Run | Each experiment data submission |

### Data Collection

| Item | When Charged |
|---|---|
| Brain Recording (EEG) | Each EEG session uploaded |
| Prompt Response | Each prompt response stored |
| Health Data Sync | Each wearable data sync |

### Storage

| Item | When Charged |
|---|---|
| Dataset Storage | Monthly for stored datasets |

### Analysis & AI

| Item | When Charged |
|---|---|
| Data Analysis | Each AI analysis run |

For current per-item costs, see the **[Pricing page](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)**.

## Per-Quest Billing

The per-quest breakdown shows:

- **Quest name** and identifier
- **Item type breakdown** — how many of each billable action occurred
- **Participant count** — total participants who incurred charges
- **Source breakdown** — charges from web vs. mobile

This helps you understand which quests are consuming the most credits and where your budget is going.

## Transaction History

Every credit deduction creates a transaction record with:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Type** | `usage`, `purchase`, `refund`, `bonus`, or `transfer` |
| **Amount** | Negative for charges, positive for additions |
| **Description** | Human-readable description of the charge |
| **Quest ID** | Which quest triggered the charge |
| **Item type** | The specific billable action |
| **Source** | `web` or `mobile` |
| **Timestamp** | When the charge occurred |

## Budget Planning

Use the **[interactive price calculator](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)** to estimate your total study cost. Enter your participant count, number of prompts, experiments, and data types, and the calculator will show a detailed cost breakdown.

<Tip>
  Your organization starts with free starter credits. For a small pilot study (10-20 participants with a single experiment), the starter credits may be sufficient.
