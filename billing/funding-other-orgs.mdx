You can transfer credits from one organization to another. This is useful for funding collaborators, sub-teams, or partner labs that are running studies on your behalf.

## Requirements

- You must have the `credits:transfer` permission (or be an admin) in the **sending** organization
- The **receiving** organization must already exist
- You need to know the receiving organization's name (searchable, minimum 3 characters)

## Transfer Limits

Minimum and maximum transfer amounts apply. See the **[Pricing page](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)** for current limits.

<Warning>
  You cannot transfer credits to the **same** organization. The source and destination must be different orgs.
</Warning>

## How to Transfer

1. Navigate to your organization's **Billing** page
2. Click **Transfer Credits**
3. Search for the destination organization (type at least 3 characters)
4. Enter the amount to transfer
5. Optionally add a **note** describing the purpose (up to 280 characters)
6. Click **Transfer**

## What Happens

When you complete a transfer:

| Side | Effect |
|---|---|
| **Sending org** | Balance decreases by the transfer amount. A transaction record is created with direction `outgoing`. |
| **Receiving org** | Balance increases by the transfer amount. A transaction record is created with direction `incoming`. |

Both organizations can see the transfer in their transaction history, including:

- The transfer amount
- The other organization's name
- The note (if provided)
- The direction (incoming/outgoing)
- The timestamp

## Use Cases

| Scenario | Example |
|---|---|
| **Funding a collaborator** | A PI transfers $100 to a partner lab running a sub-study |
| **Departmental budgeting** | A department org funds individual lab orgs at the start of the semester |
| **Splitting costs** | Two labs co-running a study split the budget via transfer |
| **Student research** | A supervisor transfers credits to a student's org for their thesis study |

## Tips

- Transfers are **instant** — credits appear in the receiving org immediately
- Both parties can see the full transfer details in their transaction history
- Use the **note** field to document the purpose (e.g., "Funding for Spring 2026 attention study")
- You can make multiple transfers — there's no limit on the number of transfers, only per-transfer amount limits
