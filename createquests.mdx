title: "How to create Quests"
---

Neurofusion offers a powerful and accessible way for researchers to conduct studies and experimentations at a significantly lower cost than traditional methods. One of the key features enabling this are "Quests." Quests are interactive, research-oriented prompts or questions designed to explore a specific topic or goal. These prompts can be used to gather insights, test hypotheses, or guide users through a structured exploration of a subject.&#x20;

Quests allow researchers to design structured data collection experiences for participants, guiding them through a series of tasks, questions, and prompts. At Neurofusion we are simplifying the way researchers explore questions, gather data, and test hypotheses. 

**Why Researchers Use Quests by Neurofusion for Research:**

* **Reduced Costs:**

  Neurofusion significantly lowers the cost of research by streamlining data collection and minimizing the need for expensive in-person studies.

* **Increased Accessibility:**

  Quests can reach a wider and more diverse participant pool, including those in remote locations or with limited mobility.

* **Improved Data Quality:**

  Structured prompts and scheduled data collection lead to more consistent and reliable data. Quests support both long-form and short-form answers, allowing for flexibility in data collection and experimentation.

* **Enhanced Participant Engagement:**

  Interactive Quests can increase participant engagement and adherence, leading to better data collection rates.

**Steps to Create a Quest**

**1. Defining the Quest** 

First, we need to define the overall objective of the Quest .Choose a clear and specific topic or goal for your Quest.

For example, "Weight Loss Goal" or "Understanding Stress Triggers."

Ensure the topic aligns with your research objectives or the insights you want to gather.

**2. Create a Quest**

After defining what the Quest topic or goals are, we can now make an interactive Quest. 

Head over to [<u>www.usefusion.ai/quests</u>](http://www.usefusion.ai/quests) to create a Quest using the button “Create Quest”.

**3. Setting up Quests**

1. First fill in the form with ‘Title’, ‘Description’, ‘Organizers’ with relevant information.

2. Next, create an onboarding question to gather permissions or initial information from participants. Here you are able to share with participants the purpose of the study, how their data will be used, and their consents.

Example: "Do you consent to share your weight loss journey data for research purposes?"

Example: "Do you agree you are over the legal age of 21?"

1. Next,

   **add prompts**

   that are relevant to your Quest topic. These can be questions or tasks that guide participants through the exploration. Prompts are the core of a Quest. They deliver questions or instructions to participants at specific times.

 For our "Weight Loss Goal" Quest, we can use a combination of daily and timed prompts.

**Example Prompts:**

* "What is your daily water intake goal?"

* "Describe your workout plan for the week."

* "What challenges do you face in maintaining a healthy diet?"

1. Choose between long-form (detailed responses) or short-form (quick answers) based on the type of data you need.

**Tip**: Enable experimentation testing if you want to test variations of prompts or questions.

**4.  Scheduling and testing Your Quest**

After creating your Quest, carefully review all prompts to ensure accuracy and clarity.

Next, set the Schedule. Define the time of day, frequency, and duration for each prompt. This ensures data is collected at the optimal times.

Once you are satisfied with the prompts and schedule, save your Quest. This will generate a unique Quest code.

Next, open the Fusion Co-pilot app, navigate to "Quests" on the app. Enter the unique Quest code generated in the previous step to launch your study.

**5. Publish and Share Your Quest**

Once your Quest is ready, share the unique Quest code with friends, participants or researchers to start collecting real-time responses.

**Experimenting with Quests**

The Fusion platform allows you to experiment with different prompts, question formats, and response types. Use this feature to:

* Test variations of prompts to see which ones yield the most insightful responses.

* Compare long-form and short-form answers to determine which format works best for your research.

* Analyze real-time data to make adjustments and improve your Quest.

**Sample of a Quest**

“Quest Title: Weight Loss Goal

Description: Weight loss tracker.

Onboarding Question: "Do you consent to share your weight loss journey data for research purposes?"

**Prompts:**

* Daily Water Intake: "What is your daily water intake goal?"

* Workout Plan: "Describe your workout plan for the week."

* Diet Challenges: "What challenges do you face in maintaining a healthy diet?"

* Progress Tracking: "How do you track your weight loss progress?"

**Answer Formats:**

* Long-form: For detailed responses (e.g., describing workout plans).

* Short-form: For quick answers (e.g., daily water intake goal).”



**Conclusion:**

Neurofusion's Quests feature empowers researchers to conduct more efficient, accessible, and cost-effective studies. By carefully designing prompts, scheduling them effectively, and leveraging the platform's features, researchers can gather valuable data and gain deeper insights into their area of study. The "Weight Loss Goal" Quest is just one example of how Neurofusion can be used to improve research outcomes. Explore the platform and discover the many possibilities for your own research projects.&#x20;
