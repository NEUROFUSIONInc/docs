A **quest** is the top-level container for a research study on NeuroFusion. It bundles together everything a study needs: prompts for recurring data collection, experiments for interactive tasks, onboarding for consent and screening, and health data configuration.

## Quest Anatomy

Every quest contains a configuration object with the following components:

| Component | Required? | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Prompts** | ✅ Yes (min 1) | Recurring questions delivered on a schedule. See [Prompts](/prompts/overview). |
| **Onboarding Questions** | Optional | Pre-join screening questions for eligibility. See [Onboarding](/onboarding/overview). |
| **Onboarding Overview** | Optional | Rich HTML consent language shown before questions. See [Full-Text Overview](/onboarding/full-text-overview). |
| **Experiments** | Optional | Interactive jsPsych tasks. See [Experiments](/experiments/overview). |
| **Health Data Config** | Optional | Toggles for collecting `steps`, `sleep`, and `heart_rate` from wearables. |
| **Assignment** | Optional | Python script for counterbalancing / conditional experiment assignment. See [Ordering & Assignment](/experiments/ordering-and-assignment). |
| **Post-Experiment Script** | Optional | Python code to run after experiment completion. |

## Quest Lifecycle

1. **Draft** — Quest is created and saved but not yet visible to participants
2. **Published** — Quest is live and accessible via its URL (consumes credits — see [Pricing](https://usefusion.ai/pricing))
3. **Active** — Participants have joined and are submitting data
4. **Unpublished** — Quest is taken offline; existing data is preserved

## Organization Scope

Every quest belongs to an **organization**. When creating a quest, you select the organization using a dropdown. All billable actions on the quest (publishing, participant joins, data submissions) are charged to the quest's organization.

<Info>
  You must create an organization before creating a quest. See [Creating an Organization](/organizations/creating-an-org) to get started.

## Data Types Collected

| Dataset Type | Source | Description |

| `experiment_data` | Web / Mobile | jsPsych experiment results (stored in Azure Blob) |
| `brain_recordings` | Web / Mobile | EEG recordings from Neurosity Crown or Muse |
| `health_data` | Mobile | Steps, sleep, heart rate from wearables |
