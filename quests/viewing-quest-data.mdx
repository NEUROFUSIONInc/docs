Once participants start joining your quest and submitting data, you can monitor and explore everything from the **quest detail page**. Navigate there by clicking on a quest from the quests list.

## Quest Detail Page Overview

The quest detail page shows:

- **Quest title, description, and status** (Draft, Published, or Unpublished)
- **Action buttons** for publishing, sharing, downloading, and refreshing data
- **Participant responses table** listing every data submission across all data types

## Data Types

All submissions are displayed in a single **Participant Responses** table with four columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| **User** | The participant's unique identifier (user GUID) |
| **Type** | The kind of data submitted (see below) |
| **Timestamp** | When the data was submitted, formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` |
| **Value** | The response content — displayed inline or with a **View data** button |

The table combines the following data types:

| Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `prompt_responses` | Answers to recurring prompts (surveys). The value contains the participant's response text or selection. |
| `onboarding_responses` | Answers to onboarding/screening questions submitted when the participant joined the quest. |
| `experiment_trials` | Results from jsPsych experiments. Stored as JSON in blob storage — click **View data** or **Download** to access. |
| `brain_recordings` | EEG recordings from Neurosity Crown or Muse devices. Stored in blob storage — click **View data** or **Download** to access. |

<Info>
  Health data (steps, sleep, heart rate) is displayed separately in a **graph view** when available, with a category selector to switch between metrics.
</Info>

## Viewing Individual Responses

### Prompt & Onboarding Responses

For `prompt_responses` and `onboarding_responses`, click the **View data** button in the Value column. A viewer panel opens below the action bar showing the response as formatted JSON.

### Experiment Trials & Brain Recordings

For `experiment_trials` and `brain_recordings`, each row shows:

- **Dataset name** — the experiment name or recording type (e.g., _"Stroop Task"_ or _"EEG Recording"_)
- **View data** — opens the data in an inline viewer panel
- **Download** — downloads the individual dataset as a JSON or CSV file
- **URL Parameters** (if present) — expandable section showing any URL parameters captured at submission time (e.g., Prolific IDs)

The downloaded file is named using the pattern:
```
{type}_{name}_{userGuid}_{timestamp}.{json|csv}
```

## Dataset Viewer

When you click **View data** on any response, a viewer panel appears showing:

- **Header** — the data type and a truncated user GUID for context
- **Content** — the full response data rendered as formatted, syntax-highlighted text
- **Close** button to dismiss the viewer

The viewer supports both JSON and plain-text content. For experiment trials and brain recordings, the data is fetched from blob storage on demand.

## Downloading All Data

Click the **Download Dataset** button in the action bar to export **all** quest data as a single CSV file.

The CSV contains the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `userGuid` | Participant identifier |
| `questGuid` | Quest identifier |
| `timestamp` | Unix timestamp of the submission |
| `type` | Data type (e.g., `prompt_responses`, `experiment_trials - Stroop Task`) |
| `value` | The full response value (JSON-encoded for complex data) |

<Tip>
  For experiment trials and brain recordings, the `type` column includes the experiment or dataset name — e.g., `experiment_trials - Stroop Task` — so you can filter by experiment in your analysis tool.
</Tip>

The file is named `quest_{questId}_data.csv`.

## Health Data (Graph View)

If your quest collects health metrics (steps, sleep, heart rate), the page includes a **graph view** showing trends over the past week.

Use the **category selector** to switch between:

| Category | Metric |
|---|---|
| Steps | Daily step count |
| Sleep | Sleep duration |
| Heart Rate | Heart rate measurements |

Each participant's data is plotted as a separate series on the line chart.

## Vital User Mapping

If your quest is integrated with the Vital API for wearable data, a **Get Vital to Fusion User Mapping** button appears in the action bar. Clicking it downloads a CSV mapping Vital user IDs to NeuroFusion user GUIDs — useful for reconciling wearable data with participant identities.

## Refreshing Data

Click the **Refresh** button to reload all datasets from the server. This fetches the latest submissions without reloading the entire page.
