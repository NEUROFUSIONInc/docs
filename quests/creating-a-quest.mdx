This guide walks you through creating a quest from scratch — selecting an organization, adding prompts and experiments, configuring onboarding, and publishing.

## Step 1: Choose an Organization

When you click **Create Quest**, you'll see an **org selector dropdown**. Choose which organization the quest belongs to — this determines who can manage the quest and where billing is charged.

- Select an existing organization from the dropdown

<Info>
  You must create an organization before creating a quest. See [Creating an Organization](/organizations/creating-an-org) to get started.
</Info>

## Step 2: Fill in Quest Metadata

- **Title** — a clear name for your study (e.g., _"Daily Mood & Sleep Tracking"_)
- **Description** — what the quest is about (shown to participants)
- **Category** — helps organize and discover quests

## Step 3: Add Prompts

Every quest requires **at least one prompt**. Prompts are the recurring questions participants answer on a schedule.

1. Click **Add Prompt**
2. Enter the prompt text
3. Select a response type (Yes/No, Text, Number, Number Range, or Custom Options)
4. Pick a category (Mental Health, Productivity, Health and Fitness, etc.)
5. Configure the schedule: active days, time window, and frequency

<Info>
  See [Prompts](/prompts/overview) for full details on response types, categories, scheduling, and conditional notifications.

## Step 4: Add Experiments (Optional)

Add interactive jsPsych experiments for participants to complete.

1. Click **Add Experiment**
2. Enter a name and optional description
3. Write or paste experiment code in the Monaco editor (starts with a default jsPsych 8.0.3 template)
4. Upload media (images, audio, video) using the media uploader
5. Use the live preview to test your experiment

You can add **multiple experiments** — they'll be displayed as a horizontal list of cards that participants navigate through.

<Info>
  See [Experiments](/experiments/overview) for full details on the editor, media uploads, and ordering.
</Info>

## Step 5: Configure Onboarding (Optional)

Set up what participants see before they join the quest:

1. **Full-text overview** — rich HTML content for informed consent, study purpose, and data usage. Participants must check an acknowledgment box before continuing.
2. **Onboarding questions** — screening questions with optional question guards to block ineligible participants.

<Info>
  See [Onboarding & Consent](/onboarding/overview) for full details on the overview, questions, guards, and kiosk mode.
</Info>

## Step 6: Configure Health Data (Optional)

Toggle which health metrics to collect from participants with wearables:

- **Steps** — daily step count
- **Sleep** — sleep duration and quality
- **Heart Rate** — heart rate measurements

## Step 7: Save

Click **Save** to store your quest. This:

- Generates a unique **quest GUID** and URL
- Enables **media uploads** for experiments (you can't upload media until the quest is saved)
- Keeps the quest in **draft** status — it's not visible to participants yet

## Step 8: Publish

Click **Publish** to make the quest live and accessible via its URL.

<Warning>
  Publishing consumes credits from the quest's organization. Make sure the org has sufficient credits. See [Pricing](https://usefusion.ai/pricing) for current costs.
</Warning>

Once published, you can share the quest link:
- **Direct link** — copy the URL and send it to participants
- **QR code** — generate a QR code for in-person recruitment
- **Prolific** — paste the URL as your Prolific study URL (see [Prolific Integration](/integrations/prolific))
