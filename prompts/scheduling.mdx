Each prompt has a schedule that controls when it's delivered to participants. Scheduling is configured along three dimensions: **active days**, **time window**, and **frequency**.

## Active Days

Choose which days of the week the prompt fires. Each day has an independent toggle.

| Day | Default |
|---|---|
| Monday | ✅ On |
| Tuesday | ✅ On |
| Wednesday | ✅ On |
| Thursday | ✅ On |
| Friday | ✅ On |
| Saturday | ✅ On |
| Sunday | ✅ On |

All days are enabled by default. Disable specific days for studies that only need data on certain days (e.g., weekdays only).

## Time Window

Set the time range during which the prompt can fire each day.

| Setting | Default | Format |
|---|---|---|
| **Start time** | `08:00` (8 AM) | HH:mm |
| **End time** | `22:00` (10 PM) | HH:mm |

- When frequency is set to **"Once"**, the picker shows a single **"At"** time, and the end time is automatically set to start + 2 minutes
- When frequency is anything else, the picker shows **"Between [start] And [end]"** with two time pickers

## Frequency

How many times per day the prompt fires within the time window.

| Label | Interval | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Once** | — | Single notification at the specified time |
| **Every 30 minutes** | 30 min | Fires every 30 minutes within the time window |
| **Every hour** | 60 min | Fires every 60 minutes within the time window |
| **Every two hours** | 120 min | Fires every 2 hours within the time window |
| **Every three hours** | 180 min | Fires every 3 hours within the time window |
| **Every four hours** | 240 min | Fires every 4 hours within the time window |

## Notifications

Each prompt has a **notifications toggle**. When enabled, participants receive push notifications at the scheduled times to remind them to respond.
