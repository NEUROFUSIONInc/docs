Prompts are the recurring questions or tasks delivered to participants at scheduled times throughout your study. They're the primary way you collect longitudinal data in NeuroFusion.

## What Is a Prompt?

A prompt is a question with:

- **Prompt text** — the question or instruction shown to participants
- **Response type** — how participants answer (Yes/No, Text, Number, Number Range, or Custom Options)
- **Category** — organizational tag (e.g., Mental Health, Productivity)
- **Schedule** — which days, what time window, and how often the prompt fires
- **Notifications** — whether to send push notifications for this prompt
- **Conditional rules** (optional) — only fire if a previous answer meets a condition

## Requirements

- Every quest must have **at least 1 prompt** to be saved
- There is no upper limit on prompts per quest

## Billing

See the [Pricing](/pricing) page for details on prompt-based billing.
