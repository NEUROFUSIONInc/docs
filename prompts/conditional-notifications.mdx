Conditional notifications let you configure a prompt to **only fire if a participant's previous answer meets a specific condition**. This is an advanced feature for creating adaptive, branching study flows.

## How It Works

Each prompt can have an optional **notify condition** with four fields:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Source Type** | What kind of question to check: `prompt` (another prompt in the quest) or `onboarding` (an onboarding question) |
| **Source ID** | Which specific prompt or onboarding question to evaluate |
| **Operator** | The comparison operator |
| **Value** | The value to compare the participant's answer against |

When a condition is set, the prompt's notification is **only sent** if the participant's answer to the source question satisfies the condition.

## Available Operators

| Operator | Label | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `eq` | Equals | Exact match (case-insensitive) |
| `neq` | Not equals | Does not match |
| `gt` | Greater than | Numeric: answer > value |
| `gte` | Greater than or equal | Numeric: answer ≥ value |
| `lt` | Less than | Numeric: answer < value |
| `lte` | Less than or equal | Numeric: answer ≤ value |

## Source Options

The source list is built from:

- **All other prompts** in the same quest (excluding the current prompt)
- **All onboarding questions** in the quest

This means you can use either a participant's ongoing prompt responses or their initial onboarding answers to determine whether a follow-up prompt should fire.

## Examples

### Follow-up on Poor Sleep

> Only ask about caffeine if the participant reported sleeping poorly.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source Type | `prompt` |
| Source | _"Did you sleep well last night?"_ (yesno prompt) |
| Operator | `eq` |
| Value | `No` |

**Result**: The caffeine prompt only fires when the participant answered "No" to the sleep prompt.

### High Stress Follow-up

> Only ask about stress coping strategies if stress rating is high.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source Type | `prompt` |
| Source | _"Rate your stress level (1–10)"_ (numberRange prompt) |
| Operator | `gte` |
| Value | `7` |

**Result**: The coping strategies prompt only fires when the participant rated stress ≥ 7.

### Based on Onboarding Answer

> Only send exercise prompts to participants who indicated they exercise regularly.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Source Type | `onboarding` |
| Source | _"Do you exercise regularly?"_ (yesno onboarding question) |
| Operator | `eq` |
| Value | `Yes` |

**Result**: Exercise-related prompts only fire for participants who answered "Yes" during onboarding.

## Tips

<Tip>
  Conditional notifications are evaluated at notification time. The condition checks the participant's **most recent** response to the source question.
</Tip>

<Warning>
  A prompt with a conditional notification will **never fire** if the source question hasn't been answered yet. Make sure the source prompt is scheduled before the conditional prompt.
</Warning>

- Use conditions to reduce participant burden — only ask follow-up questions when relevant
- Combine with the scheduling system to create sophisticated adaptive study protocols
- You can only set **one** condition per prompt
