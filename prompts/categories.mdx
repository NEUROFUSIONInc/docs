Every prompt is tagged with a **category** — a label that helps you and your participants organize and filter prompts by topic.

## Available Categories

| Category | Icon | Color | Example Prompt |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Mental Health** | 🧠 | Pink (`#FFC0CB`) | "How anxious do you feel right now?" |
| **Productivity** | 👩‍💻 | Gold (`#FFD700`) | "How many focus hours did you have today?" |
| **Relationships** | 👫 | Cyan (`#00FFFF`) | "Did you have a meaningful conversation today?" |
| **Health and Fitness** | 🏃 | Green (`#00FF00`) | "Did you exercise today?" |
| **Spiritual Practice** | 🧘 | Orange (`#FFA500`) | "Did you meditate today?" |
| **Self-Care** | 🧖 | — | "Did you take time for self-care today?" |
| **Finance** | 💸 | Red (`#FF0000`) | "How much did you spend today?" |
| **Personal Interest** | 🤩 | Purple (`#800080`) | "What hobby did you engage in?" |
| **Other** | 📁 | Black (`#000000`) | Catch-all for uncategorized prompts |

## How Categories Work

- Categories are set **per prompt**, not per quest — a single quest can have prompts across multiple categories
- Categories appear as colored badges with icons in the prompt list
- Participants see the category label when viewing their prompts
- Categories help researchers organize data during analysis

## Choosing a Category

Pick the category that best matches the research domain of your prompt. If none of the 8 specific categories fit, use **Other**.

<Tip>
  For multi-domain studies, use different categories for different prompts to make it easy to filter and analyze responses by topic area.
