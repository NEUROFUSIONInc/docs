NeuroFusion is a platform for researchers to design studies, collect behavioral and brain data from participants, and analyze results — all in one place. Whether you're running a cognitive experiment, deploying daily surveys, or tracking health metrics with wearables, NeuroFusion handles data collection, consent, billing, and collaboration so you can focus on your research.

<Note>
  **Spring 2026 Updates**

  - **Multi-experiment quests** — bundle multiple jsPsych experiments in one quest with defined ordering
  - **Improved experiment editor** — Monaco code editor with live preview and media uploads (images, audio, video)
  - **Mobile experiment runner** — participants can now complete experiments in the Fusion mobile app
  - **Organizations** — group quests under teams with 18 granular permissions and shared billing
  - **Billing & credits** — transparent per-action pricing, credit transfers between orgs
  - **Prolific compatibility** — use quest URLs directly as Prolific study URLs; participant IDs are captured automatically
  - **Onboarding flows** — full-text consent overviews, question guards to screen participants, kiosk mode for shared devices
  - **Conditional prompt notifications** — trigger prompts based on answers to previous prompts or onboarding questions
