description: "Organizations are the team-level structure in Fusion — own quests, manage members, and control billing."
---

Every quest in Fusion belongs to an **organization**. Organizations provide team-level ownership, shared billing, and fine-grained permissions for collaborating on research.

## Why Organizations?

- **Shared ownership** — quests belong to the org, not an individual
- **Billing hub** — credits are managed at the org level
- **Access control** — 18 granular permissions across 5 categories
- **Collaboration** — add team members, assign roles, share data

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| **Slug** | URL-safe identifier, auto-generated from the org name. Max 50 characters. |
| **Starter credits** | Every new organization gets **free starter credits** automatically. |
| **Owner** | The creator is automatically the first admin. |
| **Members** | Other users added by admins. Each member has a custom set of permissions. |
| **Credits** | 1 credit = 1 cent. All billing goes through the org's credit balance. |

## Organization Lifecycle

1. **Create** — choose a name, get a unique slug and free starter credits
2. **Add members** — search by username, assign permissions
3. **Create quests** — all quests are scoped to an organization
4. **Publish & run** — publishing, data collection, and storage deduct from the org's credits
5. **Monitor spending** — track expenses per quest, per item type
