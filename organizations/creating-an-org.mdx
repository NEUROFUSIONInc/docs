Creating an organization is the first step to running quests on Fusion. Every quest must belong to an organization, and creating one takes just a few seconds.

## Required Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Name** | ✅ Yes | The display name of your organization |
| **Billing Email** | ✅ Yes | Email address for billing notifications and receipts |
| **Description** | Optional | A short description of the organization |

## What Happens on Creation

When you create an organization:

1. A **unique slug** is auto-generated from your org name
   - Lowercased, non-alphanumeric characters replaced with hyphens
   - Truncated to 50 characters
   - If the slug already exists, a number suffix is appended (`-1`, `-2`, etc.)
2. You receive **free starter credits** as a welcome bonus
3. You are added as the **first admin** with full permissions

## Step by Step

1. Navigate to the **Organizations** section in the dashboard
2. Click **Create Organization**
3. Enter a **name** for your organization
4. Enter a **billing email** — this is where billing notifications and receipts will be sent
5. Optionally add a **description**
6. Click **Create**

  You can create multiple organizations — for example, one per research lab, project, or study.

## After Creation

Once your organization exists, you can:

- **Add members** — search for existing Fusion users and invite them to your org ([Members & Permissions](/organizations/members-and-permissions))
- **Create quests** — the organization selector will appear in the quest editor
- **Purchase credits** — add funds to run studies ([Purchasing Credits](/billing/purchasing-credits))

## Slug and Identity

Your organization's slug appears in URLs and is used internally to identify the org. You cannot change the slug after creation, so choose a clear, descriptive name.

**Examples:**

| Name | Generated Slug |
|---|---|
| Smith Neuroscience Lab | `smith-neuroscience-lab` |
| UofT Psych Research | `uoft-psych-research` |
| My First Study | `my-first-study` |
