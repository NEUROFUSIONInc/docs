Organizations support multiple members, each with a customizable set of permissions. This lets you control exactly who can create quests, spend credits, access data, and more.

## Adding Members

Members are added by **searching for existing Fusion users** by username:

1. Navigate to your organization's settings
2. Go to the **Members** tab
3. Search for a user by username
4. Select permissions to grant
5. Click **Add Member**

<Info>
  The user must already have a Fusion account. There is no email invitation flow — add members by their existing username.
</Info>

### Default Permissions for New Members

When you add a member, they start with these permissions:

- `quest:create` — Create Quest
- `quest:update_own` — Update Own Quests
- `credits:view_balance` — View Credit Balance
- `data:view` — View Data

## Modifying Permissions

Admins can update any member's permissions at any time:

3. Toggle permissions on or off
4. Save changes

## Owner & Admin Safeguards

Several safeguards protect organization integrity:

| Rule | Description |
|---|---|
| **Cannot remove yourself** | Use "Leave Organization" instead of removing yourself |
| **Owner cannot leave** | The organization creator cannot leave the organization |
| **Last admin protection** | The last admin cannot have their admin permission removed |
| **Only admins manage admins** | Only admins can add/remove other admins or grant sensitive permissions |

## Recommended Role Patterns
