Every quest in Fusion belongs to an organization. The organization determines who can edit the quest, where billing is charged, and who has access to collected data.

## Creating a Quest in an Organization

When you create or edit a quest, the **organization selector** appears in the quest form:

- Select which organization the quest belongs to
- All billing for the quest (publishing, data collection, etc.) is charged to that organization's credits
- Members with the appropriate permissions can view and edit the quest

<Info>
  Quests **must** belong to an organization. The organization selector is required when creating a quest.
</Info>

Helper text in the editor reads: *"Quests must belong to an organization. Billing and permissions are managed at the org level."*

## Quest Ownership Rules

| Action | Required Permission |
|---|---|
| Create a quest | `quest:create` in the target org |
| Edit any quest | `quest:update_any` or `admin` |
| Edit your own quest | `quest:update_own` |
| Publish a quest | `quest:publish` |
| Delete a quest | `quest:delete` |

## Transferring Quests

You can transfer a quest from one organization to another. This is useful when:

- A quest needs to be handed off to another team
- An organization is being reorganized
- A study is moving between labs or departments

### How to Transfer

1. Open the quest you want to transfer
2. Use the **Transfer Quest** option
3. Select the destination organization
4. Confirm the transfer

### Transfer Rules

| Scenario | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Transfer **from** an organization | `quest:create` or `admin` permission in the source org |
| Transfer **to** an organization | `quest:create` or `admin` permission in the target org |

<Warning>
  Transferring a quest moves all billing responsibility to the destination organization. Existing expenses stay with the original org, but future charges go to the new org.
</Warning>

## Bulk Transfers

A bulk transfer tool is available for moving multiple quests at once — useful during lab onboarding or when migrating between organizations.

## Viewing Organization Quests

Each organization has a dashboard showing all quests owned by that org, including:

- Quest name and status (draft / published)
- Number of participants
- Total expenses
- Last updated date
