Fusion can sync health data from wearable devices and health platforms. This enables longitudinal studies that combine behavioral experiments with physiological measures.

## Supported Platforms

| Platform | Connection Method | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Apple Health** | Direct read (iOS HealthKit) | ✅ Supported |
| **Oura Ring** | OAuth via Vital API | ✅ Supported |
| **Whoop** | OAuth via Vital API | ✅ Supported |
| **Google Fit** | — | 🔜 Coming soon |

## Data Types

Three categories of health data can be collected:

| Data Type | Description | Source |
|---|---|---|
| **Steps** | Daily step count | Pedometer / wearable |
| **Sleep** | Sleep sessions and duration | Wearable / health app |
| **Heart Rate** | Heart rate samples | Wearable / health app |

## Enabling Health Data in a Quest

When creating or editing a quest, you can enable health data collection:

1. Open the quest editor
2. Find the **Health Data** configuration section
3. Toggle the data types you want to collect:
   - ✅ Steps
   - ✅ Sleep
   - ✅ Heart Rate
4. Save the quest

<Info>
  Health data collection is only available in the **Fusion mobile app**. Participants must have the app installed and grant health permissions.
</Info>

## Connecting a Wearable

### Apple Health (Direct)

On iOS, the Fusion app reads directly from Apple HealthKit:

1. Open the quest in the Fusion mobile app
2. Grant health permissions when prompted
3. Data syncs automatically

Requested HealthKit permissions include:
- Step count
- Sleep analysis
- Heart rate
- Workout data
- Activity summary

### Oura Ring & Whoop (OAuth)

For Oura and Whoop, data syncs through the Vital cloud API:

1. Open the quest in the Fusion mobile app
2. Tap **Connect Device**
3. Select **Oura** or **Whoop**
4. You'll be redirected to the device's OAuth page
5. Sign in and authorize data sharing
6. Data syncs automatically once connected

## Data Sync

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Read** | Health data is read from the last 7 days |
| **Upload** | Data is posted to the Fusion server |
| **Storage** | Saved as a `health` dataset type in the quest |
| **Billing** | Credits charged per sync (see [Pricing](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)) |

Sync statuses you may see:

- `syncing` — Data transfer in progress
- `successSyncing` — Sync completed successfully
- `failedSyncing` — Sync failed (will retry)
- `nothingToSync` — No new data available
- `syncingCompleted` — All data types finished syncing

## Data Format

Health data is stored as JSON with one entry per date:

```json
{
  "date": "2026-03-15",
  "steps": 8432,
  "sleep": {
    "duration": 28800,
    "start": "2026-03-14T23:15:00Z",
    "end": "2026-03-15T07:15:00Z"
  },
  "heart_rate": {
    "avg": 72,
    "min": 58,
    "max": 145
  }
}
```

## Billing

Each health data sync is billed as `health_data_sync` to the quest's organization. See the **[Pricing page](https://usefusion.ai/pricing)** for current costs.

## Use Cases

| Study Type | Health Data | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Sleep & cognition** | Sleep + experiments | Correlate sleep quality with task performance |
| **Exercise & mood** | Steps + prompts | Track activity levels alongside self-reported mood |
| **Stress monitoring** | Heart rate + prompts | Combine physiological stress markers with subjective reports |
| **Longitudinal wellness** | All three | Comprehensive health tracking over weeks/months |

## Tips

- Health data syncs the **last 7 days** of data, so participants don't need to sync daily
- Combine health data with [prompts](/prompts/overview) for rich multi-modal datasets
- Ensure participants understand which health data will be collected — include this in your [onboarding consent](/onboarding/full-text-overview)
- Apple Health data is read-only — Fusion never writes to HealthKit
