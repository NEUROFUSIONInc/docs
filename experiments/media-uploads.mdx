The media uploader lets you upload files to use as stimuli in your jsPsych experiments. Files are stored in Azure Blob Storage and accessible via public URLs.

## Supported File Types

| Type | Formats |
|---|---|
| **Images** | JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, SVG |
| **Audio** | MP3, WAV, OGG |
| **Video** | MP4, WebM, OGG |

## Limits

- Maximum file size: **25 MB** per file
- No limit on the number of files

## How to Upload

1. Open your quest in the editor and navigate to an experiment
2. In the experiment editor, find the **media uploader** section
3. **Drag and drop** files onto the upload area, or **click** to browse and select files
4. Files upload immediately and appear in the media gallery below

<Warning>
  Media upload is only available **after the quest is saved for the first time**. The quest needs a GUID to associate uploaded files with. Save the quest first, then add media.
</Warning>

## Using Uploaded Files in Experiments

After uploading, each file gets a public URL. To use it in your experiment:

1. Find the file in the media gallery
2. Click the **Copy URL** button
3. Paste the URL into your experiment code as a stimulus:

```javascript
// Image stimulus
const trial = {
  type: jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse,
  stimulus: 'https://your-storage.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/face_01.png',
  choices: ['f', 'j'],
  prompt: '<p>Press F for happy, J for sad</p>'
};

// Audio stimulus
const audioTrial = {
  type: jsPsychAudioKeyboardResponse,
  stimulus: 'https://your-storage.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/tone_500hz.mp3',
  choices: ['y', 'n']
};

// Video stimulus
const videoTrial = {
  type: jsPsychVideoButtonResponse,
  stimulus: ['https://your-storage.blob.core.windows.net/uploads/clip.mp4'],
  choices: ['Continue']
};
```

<Tip>
  Use the `preload` plugin to load all media before the experiment starts. This prevents buffering delays during trials.

  ```javascript
  const preload = {
    type: jsPsychPreload,
    images: ['https://...face_01.png', 'https://...face_02.png'],
    audio: ['https://...tone_500hz.mp3']
  };
  ```
</Tip>

## Managing Uploads

- **View**: All uploaded files appear in a gallery below the upload area
- **Delete**: Click the delete button on any file to remove it from storage
- Deleting a file **does not** automatically update experiment code that references it — update your code manually

## Example Workflow

Building a face-recognition experiment:

1. Create and save your quest
2. Add an experiment called "Face Recognition Task"
3. Upload your face images (e.g., `happy_01.png`, `sad_01.png`, `neutral_01.png`)
4. Copy each image URL
5. Reference the URLs in your jsPsych timeline:

```javascript
const faces = [
  { stimulus: 'https://.../happy_01.png', correct_response: 'h' },
  { stimulus: 'https://.../sad_01.png', correct_response: 's' },
  { stimulus: 'https://.../neutral_01.png', correct_response: 'n' }
];

const trial = {
  type: jsPsychImageKeyboardResponse,
  stimulus: jsPsych.timelineVariable('stimulus'),
  choices: ['h', 's', 'n'],
  data: { correct_response: jsPsych.timelineVariable('correct_response') }
};

const procedure = {
  timeline: [trial],
  timeline_variables: faces,
  randomize_order: true
};
```
