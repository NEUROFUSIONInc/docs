The Fusion mobile app supports running jsPsych experiments directly on participants' phones and tablets. Experiments render in a WebView with automatic orientation handling and local-first data storage.

## How It Works

1. Participant opens the quest in the Fusion mobile app
2. Taps on an experiment card to start
3. The experiment loads in a **full-screen WebView**
4. Screen **locks to landscape orientation** for the duration of the experiment
5. When the experiment calls `jatos.endStudy(data)`, the data is captured
6. Screen returns to **portrait orientation**
7. A completion alert shows the number of trials recorded

## Data Flow

| Step | What Happens |
|---|---|
| **Capture** | `jatos.endStudy()` is intercepted by the React Native bridge |
| **Local save** | Data is saved to AsyncStorage immediately (offline-safe) |
| **Server sync** | Data is uploaded to Azure Blob Storage when connection is available |
| **Dataset record** | Saved as `experiment_data` with source `mobile` |

<Info>
  Data is saved **locally first**, so experiment data is not lost if the participant loses connectivity during or after the experiment. It syncs to the server automatically when a connection is available.
</Info>

## Differences from Web

| Feature | Web | Mobile |
|---|---|---|
| **Orientation** | No forced orientation | Locks to landscape during experiments |
| **Data storage** | Direct server upload | Local-first with background sync |
| **CORS/CSP** | Browser-handled | Auto-injected by the app |
| **Error handling** | Standard browser console | Captures `console.error`, unhandled rejections, and global errors |
| **Export** | Download from dashboard | Share as JSON file via device share sheet |

## Export on Mobile

Participants can export their experiment data directly from the mobile app:

1. Navigate to the completed experiment
2. Use the **export** option
3. Data is saved as a JSON file and shared via the device's share sheet (AirDrop, email, Files, etc.)

This uses `expo-file-system` and `expo-sharing` under the hood.

## When to Use Mobile vs. Web

| Use Case | Recommended |
|---|---|
| In-field / take-home studies | ✅ Mobile |
| Prolific recruitment | ✅ Web |
| EEG sessions with mobile app | ✅ Mobile |
| Large-screen experiments (complex layouts) | ✅ Web |
| Studies requiring precise keyboard input | ✅ Web |
| Participants without computer access | ✅ Mobile |
| Lab-based with shared computers | ✅ Web + [Kiosk Mode](/onboarding/kiosk-mode) |

## Tips

<Tip>
  Design your experiment layout to work well in **landscape orientation** on phone-sized screens. Test on actual devices before launching.
</Tip>

- Experiments run on both iOS and Android through the Fusion app
- The same experiment code works on both web and mobile — no separate version needed
- Mobile data is tagged with source `mobile` so you can distinguish it from web data in your analysis
- If your experiment uses touch input instead of keyboard, it will work naturally on mobile
- Benign CORS "Script error." messages are automatically filtered on mobile
